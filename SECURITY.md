Copyright is a legal mechanism that grants the creator the exclusive right to use and distribute an original work. Copyright extends to the material expression of ideas — texts, music, photographs, videos, software code and other forms of creativity.

Some ways to protect copyright:
Recording the violation. It is necessary to save all evidence of illegal use (screenshots, copies of pages, video recordings).
Identifying the violator. It is necessary to determine who exactly violated the rights — a specific person, a company or a hosting provider.
Sending a claim. It is necessary to send an official notice of violation with a demand to stop using and compensate for damages.
Contacting intermediaries. If the violation occurs on an online platform, you can use its rights protection mechanisms (DMCA complaints).
Pre-trial settlement. You should try to agree with the violator on voluntary compensation and termination of the violation.
Lawsuit. If the previous steps are ineffective, you can go to court with a statement of claim.
